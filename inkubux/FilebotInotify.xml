        FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your movies, tv shows or anime, and music well as downloading subtitles and artwork. It's smart and just works.
        This image wraps filebot into inotify and watch a folder /watch.
        [b][span style='color: #E80000;']Directions:[/span][/b][br]
        [b]/watch[/b] : in this path inotify will wait for any text file and will execute filebot that is setted to execute on the [b]/download[/b] folder.[br]
        [b]/downloads[/b] : This is where filebot will be executed[br]
        [b]/media[/b] : This is where filebot will place the file[br]
        [b]/config[/b] : This is where filebot will place the his config files file. In this folder there will be the log and the exclude file from the filebot amc process[br][br]

        [b]Tip:[/b] You will find in [b]/config/scripts[/b] 2 scripts [br]
        [b]filebot.sh[/b] This is where you can modify the filebot script to fit your needs
        [b]postprocess.sh[/b] This is script will be called after the main filebot script so you can add any postprocess script as you need. [b]ex:[/b] Here I usually put curl calls to deluge to move the storage somewhere else than /downloads
